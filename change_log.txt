/* changelog

v1.0.8
    - [fix] switching off dummy load will apply tuner updates if required
    - [fix] fix issue where frequency not sent to radio when returning from a band that was set to bypass

v1.0.7
    - [add] option to send frequency to tuner when in Bypass mode (default off)
    - [add] dummy load support. An antenna can be chosen to switch to when the dummy load button is pressed. Bypass is also selected

v1.0.6
    - [change] single click on task tray icon will show main window
    - [change] supports the new Thetis tci message format for tx_frequency_thetis
    - [fix] typo in settings - thanks gw4ogo for the report
    - [fix] fixed some issues that would prevent the window from being shown if minimise has been used, or windows sleep

v1.0.5
    - [add] added info icon/tooltip to the antenna frequency change section in the advanced config page
    - [add] selecting show from the icon tray icon menu, or double clicking the icon tray icon, will bring to top the main window
    - [change] when initially connected to the tuner, send the frequency change twice. This fixes the issue where the first frequency sent to the tuner recovers the incorrect C/L values, probably caused by an issue with the firmware

v1.0.4
    - [change] frequency is now sent in BYPASS mode again, as preventing this caused some issues. It is still prevented in when in setup

v1.0.3
    - [add] frequency is now sent to the tuner if antenna changes. [Send frequency to Tuner] needs to be checked for this to happen. It will also happen if the antenna is changed from the front of the hardware
    - [add] support added for TX tracking (split etc) when using OmniRig / TCPIP/cat
    - [change] delay added for flight time so that the tuner has time to act on the messages that are sent to it. Currently this is 5 times the ms taken for the serial data to be sent at the given baud rate/stopbits/databits etc
    - [change] frequency is not sent to the tuner when it is in setup or bypass

v1.0.2
    - [add] weather support added using https://openweathermap.org/api . Antenna will move to configure port based on weather. You can obtain a free API key on their website for current weather. Just make an account and you should find it there
    - [add] antenna can be configured to move to a port after idle time. Any use of the tuner will reset this time. Any use of HF-AUTO controller will reset this time
    - [add] weather icon shown on main window if weather support in use
    - [add] support for ExpertElectonics range of radios via TCI
    - [add] OmniRig support to provide support for other systems
    - [add] TCPIP/Cat support, with poll frequency options
    - [add] Options to simulate HasRF and Frequency for older firmwares that do not provide it (v2.36 for example)
    - [add] code added to work around the issue where tuner does not select correct C/L for first frequency sent to it after a power cycle

v1.0.1
    - [add] frequency will be sent to the tuner, bypassing filters, if [Force SetFreq] button pressed
    - [add] option to not update tuner frequency if in manual mode unless the force button is used
    - [add] comport will be disconnected/reconnescted at system sleep/restore
    - [add] on successful load of config, a backup is created. If issue loading the backup will be tried
    - [add] added licence to install folder
    - [add] added change log to install folder
    - [add] hold CTRL at start if you have lost the window. It will reposition on main screen
    - [change] improved warning messages if com port fails to open, and they will now be forced on top
    - [fix] fixed issue where comport might not be in the format of COMn where n is a number. Would cause crash
    - [info] settings stored in 'Documents\Blitter8\HF-AUTO' for those wanting to take a backup

v1.0.0 - initial release
