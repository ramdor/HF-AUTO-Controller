/* changelog

v1.0.3
    - [add] frequency is now sent to the tuner if antenna changes. [Send frequency to Tuner] needs to be checked for this to happen. It will also happen if the antenna is changed from the front of the hardware
    - [add] support added for TX tracking (split etc) when using OmniRig / TCPIP/cat
    - [change] delay added for flight time so that the tuner has time to act on the messages that are sent to it. Currently this is 5 times the ms taken for the serial data to be sent at the given baud rate/stopbits/databits etc
    - [change] frequency is not sent to the tuner when it is in setup or bypass

v1.0.2
    - [add] weather support added using https://openweathermap.org/api . Antenna will move to configure port based on weather. You can obtain a free API key on their website for current weather. Just make an account and you should find it there
    - [add] antenna can be configured to move to a port after idle time. Any use of the tuner will reset this time. Any use of HF-AUTO controller will reset this time
    - [add] weather icon shown on main window if weather support in use
    - [add] support for ExpertElectonics range of radios via TCI
    - [add] OmniRig support to provide support for other systems
    - [add] TCPIP/Cat support, with poll frequency options
    - [add] Options to simulate HasRF and Frequency for older firmwares that do not provide it (v2.36 for example)
    - [add] code added to work around the issue where tuner does not select correct C/L for first frequency sent to it after a power cycle

v1.0.1
    - [add] frequency will be sent to the tuner, bypassing filters, if [Force SetFreq] button pressed
    - [add] option to not update tuner frequency if in manual mode unless the force button is used
